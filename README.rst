Elephant
========

Basically, this is an HTTP key/value store with full-text search and fast queries. 

Search and query functionality is all provided by a backing Elastic Seach server. Everything is immediately replicated to S3 as JSON documents.

Simplicity â€” full-text search, HTTP, persitience, data portability.

Enjoy.
